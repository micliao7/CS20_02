            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>With the repair costs of glasses being so high, we wanted to 
                create a product that would help people save money and extend 
                the life of their glasses. Therefore, we created or specialized
                tape designed to put broken frames and glasses back together. 
                Our tape is designed to be easy to use and effective at 
                repairing glasses, and we are committed to providing our 
                customers with the best possible service and support.
            </p>
